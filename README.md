Simulation of of Diffusion Limited Aggregation Model and estimation of stickiness paramters

It's the diffusion limited aggregation model simulation implemented in python and few of data points have generated from it to support the hypothesis of stickiness parameter.

Algorithmic optimization by using the idea of growing circles has been implemented. Please check out the notebook and ping me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/datascientist-/ . if you have any queries or suggestion in the simulation or the hypothesis testing. 


The simulation has been implemented with a very few data points due to various constraints like time,computational power etc. but these data looks promising to me.
